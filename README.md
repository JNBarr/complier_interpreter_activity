# complier_interpreter_activity
Some code I wrote following a compiler and interpreter activity online. May need some modification to work in Python 3; please review the code first.

YOU WILL GET SYNTAX ERRORS.

But the code is correct, I jump between a lot of languages and always forget python uses tabbing to partiton code. Just indent where needed. Will correct when the time is right.
